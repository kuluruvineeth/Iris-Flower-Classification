# Iris-Flower-Classification

* Attributes are numeric so we have to figure out how to load and handle data
* It is a classification problem,allows to practice with an easier type of supervised learning algorithm.
* It is a multiclass classification problem(multi-nomial).
* It only has 4 attributes and 150 rows,meaning it is small and easily fits into memory
* All of the numeric attributes are in the same units and the same scale not requiring any special scaling or transforms.


## [Steps followed to work through small machine learning project end-to-end]
1. **Loading the dataset**
2. **Summarizing the dataset**
3. **Visualizing the dataset**
4. **Evaluating some algorithms**
5. **Making some predictions
